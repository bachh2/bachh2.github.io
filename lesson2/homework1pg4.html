    <h1>Selling Treasure</h1>

        <p class="flavor">
            Opportunities abound to find treasure, equipment, weapons, armor, and
            more in the dungeons you explore. Normally, you can sell your treasures
            and trinkets when you return to a town or other settlement, provided
            that you can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot.
        </p>
        <h2>Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment</h2>
        <p class="detail">
            As a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch
            half their cost when sold in a market. Weapons and armor used by
            monsters are rarely in good enough condition to sell.
        </p>
        <h2>Magic Items</h2>
        <p class="detail">
            Selling magic items is problematic. Finding someone to buy a potion or a
            scroll isn't too hard, but other items are out of the realm of most but
            the wealthiest nobles. Likewise, aside from a few common magic items,
            you won't normally come across magic items or spells to purchase. The
            value of magic is far beyond simple gold and should always be treated as
            such.
        </p>
        <h2>Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects</h2>
        <p class="detail">
            These items retain their full value in the marketplace, and you can
            either trade them in for coin or use them as currency for other
            transactions. For exceptionally valuable treasures, the DM might require
            you to find a buyer in a large town or larger community first.
        </p>
        <h2>Trade Goods and Other</h2>
        <p class="detail">
            On the borderlands, many people conduct transactions through barter.
            Like gems and art objects, trade goods--bars of iron, bags of salt,
            livestock, and so on--retain their full value in the market and can be
            used as currency.
