            The marketplace of a large city teems with buyers and sellers of many
            sorts: dwarf smiths and elf woodcarvers, halfling farmers and gnome
            jewelers, not to mention humans of every shape, size, and color drawn
            from a spectrum of nations and cultures. In the largest cities, almost
            anything imaginable is offered for sale, from exotic spices and
            luxurious clothing to wicker baskets and practical swords.

            For an adventurer, the availability of armor, weapons, backpacks, rope,
            and similar goods is of paramount importance, since proper equipment can
            mean the difference between life and death in a dungeon or the untamed
            wilds. This section details the mundane and exotic merchandise that
            adventurers commonly find useful in the face of the threats that the
            worlds of D&D present.
