    <h1>Wealth</h1>
    <p class="flavor">
        Wealth appears in many forms in a D&D world. Coins, gemstones, trade
        goods, art objects, animals, and property can reflect your characterâ€™s
        financial well-being. Members of the peasantry trade in goods, bartering
        for what they need and paying taxes in grain and cheese.
    </p>
    <p class="flavor">
        Members of the nobility trade either in legal rights, such as the rights
        to a mine, a port, or farmland, or in gold bars, measuring gold by the
        pound rather than by the coin. Only merchants, adventurers, and those
        offering professional services for hire commonly deal in coins.

            spend most of his gold on quills and papers for his research

        <h2>Coinage</h2>
    </div>

    <img src="img/coin.jpg" alt="coin-dnd" />
    <div>
        <p class="detail">
            Common coins come in several different denominations based on the
            relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most
            common coins are the gold piece (<b>gp</b>), the silver piece
            (<b>sp</b>), and the copper piece (<b>cp</b>).
        </p>
        <p class="flavor">
            With one gold piece, a character can buy a bedroll, 50 feet of good
            rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one
            gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for
            wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants
            discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands
            of gold pieces, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of
            individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value,
            and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable
            goods.
        </p>
        <p class="flavor">
            One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among
            commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer's work for half a day, a flask
            of lamp oil, or a night's rest in a poor inn.
        </p>
        <p class="flavor">
            One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among
            laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a
            piece of chalk.
        </p>
        <p class="detail">
            In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes
            appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (<i>ep</i>) and the
            platinum piece (<i>pp</i>) originate from fallen empires and lost
            kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used
            in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a
            platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.
        </p>
        <p class="detail">
            A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a
            pound.
