    <h1>Starting Equipment</h1>
    <p class="flavor">
        When you create your character, you receive equipment based on a
        combination of your class and background. Alternatively, you can start
        with a number of gold pieces based on your class and spend them on items
        from the lists in this section. See the Starting Wealth by Class table to
        determine how much gold you have to spend.
    </p>
    <p class="detail">
        You decide how your character came by this starting equipment. It might
        have been an inheritance, or goods that the character purchased during his
        or her upbringing. You might have been equipped with a weapon, armor, and
        a backpack as part of military service. You might even have stolen your
        gear. A weapon could be a family heirloom, passed down from generation to
        generation until your character finally took up the mantle and followed in
        an ancestorâ€™s adventurous footsteps.
